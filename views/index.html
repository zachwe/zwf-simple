    <h1>Zach Wener-Fligner</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a software engineer and sometimes-writer who currently lives in San
        Francisco, California. I work at <a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a>, 
        where I build products that help thousands of our customers make sense
        of billions of data points on their users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, I worked at <a href="http://qz.com">Quartz</a> as
        part of the Atlantic Media Fellowship, a selective yearlong fellowship
        for recent college graduates to work for The Atlantic and its sister
        publications. The fellowship lasts through June 2014.

    <p><a href="/zwf-resume-01-15.pdf">Here</a> is my resume.</p>
    <p><strong>Brief bio</strong></p>
    <p>I grew up in Seattle, Washington, where I attended <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_High_School_%28Seattle,_Washington%29">Garfield
        High School</a>. In high school, I wrote and then edited the school
    paper, won a state team chess championship, drove an ice cream truck for a
    business I started with two close friends, and interned at Microsoft.
    </p>
    <p>
    I graduated from the <a href="http://mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute
        of Technology</a> in 2014 where I studied <a
        href="https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18c.php">Mathematics
        with Computer Science</a> and
    minored in <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu/">Writing</a>.
    </p>
    <p>During college, I did software engineering internships at Google,
    Amazon, and Flotype, a startup that was part of the Y Combinator winter
    2011 cohort. I also hosted a hip-hop, funk, and r&b radio show on MIT's
    student radio station, banditted the Boston Marathon, and played a lot of soccer.</p>
